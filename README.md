# 👨‍💻 Welcome to my GitHub Profile!

Hi, I’m **Vinicius Gonzaga Silva**, an IT student passionate about technology, cloud infrastructure, and cybersecurity. I use GitHub not only as a version control platform but also as an essential tool in my journey to master cloud computing environments and DevOps practices.

## ☁️ Cloud Computing & GitHub Integration

As cloud technologies become the backbone of modern IT systems, I’m focusing on learning how to integrate GitHub into various cloud-based workflows. Here’s how I’m applying these concepts:

- 🔄 **CI/CD Pipelines**: I plan to use **GitHub Actions** to automate build, test, and deployment processes for web applications hosted on **AWS** and **Azure**.
- 🐳 **Containerization**: I'm exploring how to manage and deploy Docker containers directly from GitHub to cloud platforms.
- 🔐 **Security & IAM**: Understanding permission management, token handling, and secure code practices is part of my cloud-learning path.
- 📡 **Remote Collaboration**: GitHub enables real-time collaboration with teams and serves as a centralized platform for open-source contributions.

By combining GitHub and cloud computing, I aim to build scalable, secure, and automated systems.

## 📚 What You’ll Find in My Repositories

Here are some areas I’m currently working on:

- 🌐 Basic networking and server configuration scripts  
- 🧠 Learning projects involving **Git**, **Markdown**, and **CI/CD**  
- 🗃️ Database connection and security implementation samples  
- 📁 Future projects hosted with cloud-based deployment in mind  

Each repository includes detailed documentation using Markdown for clear communication, version history for transparency, and future plans outlined in the issues and README sections.

# 👋 Hi there! I'm Vinicius Gonzaga Silva

I'm an enthusiastic **Information Technology** student, currently building a strong foundation in networking, cybersecurity, and systems development. I'm always exploring new tools and platforms that can enhance my technical skills and prepare me for a professional career in the IT field.

## 💻 About My Interest in GitHub

I see **GitHub** as one of the most valuable tools in my learning journey. It allows me to:
- Safely store and version my projects.
- Collaborate with other developers and students.
- Document my progress in an organized and accessible way.
- Connect with a global tech community.

I'm starting to use GitHub to develop scripts, organize study materials, and share small projects involving networks, databases, and information security.

## ☁️ GitHub + Cloud Computing

I recognize a strong connection between **GitHub** and **cloud computing**, as both support remote access, continuous collaboration, and automation. I plan to integrate my repositories with cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud to:
- Host web applications.
- Create test and development environments using containers.
- Automate tasks using CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions.

I believe mastering these integrations will be essential for my future academic and professional projects.
